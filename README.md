# 100mountains-eth - ERC721 NFT Dapp 
# Built using scaffold-eth

100mountains-eth is a standalone primary storefront for the launch of @soundwavesphoton 100mountains-eth collection.

The 100mountains-eth platform integrates a buyer-mints marketplace that will allow visitors to verifiably mint and own the genesis pieces of @soundwavesphoton 100mountains Collection.

The collection is composed of 100 abstract visuals accompanied by custom audio. Buyers who mint an NFT from the collection through our platform will have the option to obtain a second secret token in their wallet. Upon burning the secret token, @soundawesphoton will send a physical (real life) copy of the nft graphic.
